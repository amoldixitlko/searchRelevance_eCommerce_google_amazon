# searchRelevance_eCommerce_google_amazon

This is a report addressing the strengths of two market leaders in the arena of online search. Google has had years on dominance as a search engine and generates the major share of its revenue through Google Ads. Amazon has grown in the last decade unlike any other and has revolutionised the retail market in a short span of few years. 

This also tries to show the basic differences in the searches and their composition between the two companies and how Amazon has the option to bite into the market share of Google at which it has been successful in the recent years.  

This report judges considers the results obtained through the searches from both Google and Amazon and critically analyses their composition on the basis of number of ads, their location, the composition of webpage, position of organic results, and other distinguishing features of ads. Few inferences are also drawn through Amazonâ€™s search results and are detailed in the report, and finally a suggestion is made as to how a company should allocate its digital marketing budget. 

This report should be read alongside the shared file (SearchAnalysis.xlsm), as the complete source of information which is tabulated in it. Also, some charts are referred in this report but not presented as their size would render them unreadable here. The Visual Basic code results are already updated in the table based on the observed data. Some columns have been hidden with the intent of abstraction, feel free to unhide them and view the whole table. The file is also attached in this report as an Appendix.
